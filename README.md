This is the fifth project. This is about creating day planner app for anyone that needs it. Using API keys and activating them on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it allows two or more applications to transfer, store, manipulate databases, make requests,  before sending responses to the server. Since I am used JQuery and Bootstrap, I am going to create into a calendar app that makes sense. 
 
 User's Story:
 
 A person is working on a computer every day might not have the time to write things down with regular notes or a simple calendar planner. An online Calculate-this-day Calendar planner is the best option for them. It is sexy and simple to save the events.

I made this project to save times and dates. It helps to move your schedule up and know how are going with your day. Another motivation is that it calculates 
everything at that moment.It helps my undestanding of how functions and methods work together smoothly to create this beautiful machine. It is makes to sit and drink latte.


Problem(s) it solves: syntax/grammatical errors, spacing/formatting, argument list, scoping, Undefined variables and functions

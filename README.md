This is the fifth project. This is about creating the plan scheduler. Using API keys and activating them on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it allows two 
or more applications to transfer store, manipulate databases, make requests,  before sending responses to the server. Since I am used JQuery and Bootstrap, I am going to
create into a calendar app that makes sense. 


Motivation(s)
I made this project to save times and dates. It helps to move your schedule up and know how are going with your day. Another motivation is that it calculates 
everything at that moment. It is makes to sit and drink latte.
